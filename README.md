## 🚀 Projects & Case Studies

Here you will find detailed documentation for each of my cybersecurity projects, including methodologies, tools used, findings, and lessons learned.

1.  **Network Port & Firewall Audit**
    * **Description:** A practical case study on auditing local network ports and firewall configurations on personal workstations (macOS/Windows) to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure defensive measures are in place.
    * **Skills Demonstrated:** Network reconnaissance, port scanning (local), firewall analysis, basic security hardening, understanding of attack surface.
    * **[Project Details](Network-Port-Audit/README.md)** <-- **Вот здесь очень важно! Эта ссылка ведет к твоему первому проекту.**

2.  **[Placeholder for Nmap Advanced Scan Case]**
    * **Description:** (Will be filled after we learn advanced Nmap techniques)
    * **Skills Demonstrated:** (Will be filled after we learn advanced Nmap techniques)
